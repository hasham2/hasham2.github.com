<p>Liquid error: No such file or directory - /home/hasham/apps/hasham2.github.com/_posts/_includes SQLite is light weight embedded relational database that you can easily use in your clojure/compojure projects during development. Once you have tested your application in local enviorment you can choose to move to any other SQL compliant databases (ie MySQL, PostgreSQL)</p>

<p>Assuming that you have generated your project with Lein (which is awesome build tool for clojure developers) there would be <code>project.clj</code> file in root directory of your app. Add reference to SQLite and JDBC driver in dependencies. Your project file would look something like this with SQLite drivers added:</p>

<pre><code>(defproject myapp &quot;0.0.1&quot;
  :description &quot;my app&quot;
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure &quot;1.3.0&quot;]
                 [org.clojure/java.clojurejdbc &quot;0.0.6&quot;]
                 [org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc &quot;3.6.13&quot;] 
                 [ring/ring-jetty-adapter &quot;1.0.1&quot;]
                 [compojure &quot;0.6.4&quot;]
                 [hiccup &quot;0.3.6&quot;]])</code></pre>

<p>After this you would want to create a migration so that you can create database file and a tables in database. SQLite databases are stored on your file system. Here are setting you would use for SQLite in your <code>migration.clj</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>(def db {
    :classname &quot;org.sqlite.JDBC&quot;
    :subprotocol &quot;sqlite&quot;
    :subname &quot;db/database.db&quot;})</code></pre>

<p>Your migration file should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>(ns shouter.models.migration
    (:require [clojure.java.jdbc :as sql]))

(def db {
      :classname &quot;org.sqlite.JDBC&quot;
      :subprotocol &quot;sqlite&quot;
      :subname &quot;db/database.db&quot;})

(defn create-posts [] 
      (try (sql/with-connection db
        (sql/create-table :posts
          [:id :serial &quot;PRIMARY KEY&quot;]
          [:title :varchar &quot;NOT NULL&quot;]
          [:body :varchar &quot;NOT NULL&quot;]
          [:created_at :timestamp &quot;NOT NULL&quot; &quot;DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP&quot;]))
      (catch Exception e (println e)))
)

(defn -main []
      (print &quot;Migrating database ... &quot;) (flush)
      (create-posts)
      (println &quot;Done ...&quot;)
)</code></pre>

<p>Thats it!</p>
